### Description:

Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits for storage (in a file or memory buffer) or transmission across a network connection link to be reconstructed (deserialized) later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. Ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.



### Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]

### Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []



### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 104
- The input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.
