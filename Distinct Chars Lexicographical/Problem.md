### Description:

Given a string s, remove all duplicate characters such that every letter appears only once in smallest lexicographical order.

Equivalently, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s that contains all the distinct characters of s exactly once.



### Example 1:

Input: s = "bcabc"

Output: "abc"

### Example 2:

Input: s = "cbacdcbc"

Output: "acdb" 



### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists only of lowercase English letters
