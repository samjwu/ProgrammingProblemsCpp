### Description:

Given a circular list of non-negative integers, determine the maximum sum of nonconsecutive integers.

In essence, determine the maximum sum of integers that are chosen such that no two integers are right beside each other in the input array. Note that in a circular list, the last and first elements are considered to be adjacent/consecutive.



### Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,2]

Output: 3

Explanation: Choose i=1. Value = 3.
Cannot pick i=[0, 2] because in a circular array they are adjacent/consecutive.

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: 4

Explanation: Choose i = [0, 3]. Values = [1, 3]
Max = 1 + 3 = 4.

### Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]

Output: 0


### Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
